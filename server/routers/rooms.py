"""Room endpoints: list, detail, and schedule.

Each endpoint combines two sources:
- 25Live (official rooms and bookings), via services.live25
- our database (rooms we've configured, requests, waitlist, closures)

The merging itself lives in services.room_merge.

Room ids in URLs are 25Live space_ids (e.g. "1810"), matched to our rooms via
Room.external_ref. Rooms that exist only in our database use their UUID.
